  For Experiment 2, the results seem stable even after applying cross
  validation (compute factors from a training set, then compute factor scores
  and regression coefficients from a separate test set).

  However for Experiment 1, the results look different. Even after matching
  the factors to those of Experiment 2, we only find partially the same
  results. Consistently, factor Anxious-Depression (AD) has a negative
  association with mean confidence. But there is no positive association
  between factor Compulsivity (C) and mean confidence. Moreover,
  Social-Withdrawal (SW) also has a clera negative association with mean
  confidence. This also shows up in the cross validation analysis.

  Additionally, correlation analyses based on single questionnaires seem to
  support these findings. (But note that the regression analyses controlled
  for covariates gender, age, and IQ which is not reflected in these
  correlations.)
