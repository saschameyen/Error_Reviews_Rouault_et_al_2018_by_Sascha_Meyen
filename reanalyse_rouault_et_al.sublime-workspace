But split-half reliabilities would also be                                                                                                           \n  problematic because I am not aware of a Spearman-Brown-like correction for                                                                                                  \n  reliabilities when using split-half reliabilities on M-Ratio.                                                                                                               \n                                                                                                                                                                              \n  Factor Analysis and Regression                                                                                                                                              \n                                                                                                                                                                              \n  For Experiment 2, the results seem stable even after applying cross                                                                                                         \n  validation (compute factors from a training set, then compute factor scores                                                                                                 \n  and regression coefficients from a separate test set).                                                                                                                      \n                                                                                                                                                                              \n  However for Experiment 1, the results look different.

But there is no positive association                                                                                                      \n  between factor Compulsivity (C) and mean confidence. Moreover,                                                                                                              \n  Social-Withdrawal (SW) also has a clera negative association with mean                                                                                                      \n  confidence.

The reliability of                                                                                                                                        \n  M-Ratio is less good with Rel ~ .64.                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n  In Experiment 2, the accuracy was kept constant by a staircase procedure.                                                                                                                                  \n  This drops the reliability of accuracy down to around .5. The reliability                                                                                                                                  \n  of mean confidences remains high at .99. The reliability of M-Ratio drops                                                                                                                                  \n  further down to .19.                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n  Note that I used Monte Carlo bootstrap simulations to determine these                                                                                                                                      \n  reliabilities I did not use stratification because there were very trials                                                                                                                                  \n  per difficulty condition within the participants. So these results are only                                                                                                                                \n  a rough approximation. But split-half reliabilities would also be                                                                                                                                          \n  problematic because I am not aware of a Spearman-Brown-like correction for                                                                                                                                 \n  reliabilities when using split-half reliabilities on M-Ratio.                                                                                                                                              \n                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n                                                                                                                                                                                                             \nFactor Analysis and Regression                                                                                                                                                                               \n                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n  For Experiment 2, the results seem stable even after applying cross                                                                                                                                        \n  validation (compute factors from a training set, then compute factor scores                                                                                                                                \n  and regression coefficients from a separate test set).                                                                                                                                                     \n                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n  However for Experiment 1, the results look different. Even after matching                                                                                                                                  \n  the factors to those of Experiment 2, we only find partially the same                                                                                                                                      \n  results.
